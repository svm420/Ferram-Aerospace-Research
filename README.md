## Installation

Install by merging the GameData folder in the zip with the GameData folder in your KSP install

ModuleManager and ModularFlightIntegrator are REQUIRED for FAR to work properly.  Failing to copy this over will result in strange errors.

## Legacy wing configs

Sample Part.cfg:

For wings

```cfg
MODULE  
{  
    name = FARControllableSurface / FARWingAerodynamicModel  
    b_2 = 0.5                       // distance from wing root to tip; semi-span  
    MAC = 0.5                       // Mean Aerodynamic Chord  
    nonSideAttach = 0               // 0 for canard-like / normal wing pieces, 1 for ctrlsurfaces attached to the back of other wing parts  
    TaperRatio = 0.7                // Ratio of tip chord to root chord generally < 1, must be > 0  
    MidChordSweep = 25              // Sweep angle in degrees; measured down the center of the span / midchord position  
    maxdeflect = 15                 // Default maximum deflection value; only used by FARControlableSurface  
    controlSurfacePivot = 1, 0, 0;  // Local vector that obj_ctrlSrf pivots about; defaults to 1, 0, 0 (right)  
    ctrlSurfFrac = 0.2              // Value from 0-1, percentage of the part that is a flap; only used by FARControlableSurface  
}
```

For control surfaces, use above but replace `FARWingAerodynamicModel` with `FARControllableSurface` and add `maxdeflect` value

Set all the other winglet/control surface values to zero

## CHANGELOG

0.16.1.2V "Marangoni"------------------------------------  

Fixed `submergedDynamicPressurekPa` and `dynamicPressurekPa` not getting set to 0 when part becomes shielded, thanks [@siimav](https://github.com/siimav) [#145](https://github.com/dkavolis/Ferram-Aerospace-Research/pull/145)  

0.16.1.1V "Marangoni"------------------------------------

Fixed invalid aero simulation values in editor  

0.16.1.0V "Marangoni"------------------------------------  

[Experimental, WIP] Rendering based exposed surface computation approach. At the moment, has no effect on physics computations and doesn't work with OpenGL, and thus is disabled by default. Can be enabled from the debug window in flight GUI and contains settings and visualizations only. Has a low-to-moderate performance cost. Requires KSPBurst as dependency and KSP 1.12.  
Respect shielding for chute deployment [4121b20](https://github.com/dkavolis/Ferram-Aerospace-Research/commit/4121b2036c20cf75a4eaac781a5d33bf186f3972)

Introduction of ModularFlightIntegrator for interfacing with KSP drag / heating systems without interference with other mods

Replaced previous part-based drag model with new vessel-centered, voxel-powered model:  

* Generates voxel model of vehicle using part meshes, accounting for part clipping  
* Drag is calculated for vehicle as a whole, rather than linear combination of parts  
* Payload fairings and cargo bays are emergent from code and do not require special treatment with configs  
* Area ruling of vehicles is accounted for; unsmooth area distributions will result in very high drag at and above Mach 1  
* Body lift accounts for vehicle shape in determining potential and viscous flow contributions  
* Areas exposed to outside used for stock heating calculations  

Performance optimizations in legacy wing model  
Jet engine windmilling drag accounted for at intakes  

Editor GUI improvements including:  

* Greater clarity in AoA / Mach sweep tab

* Addition of a Transonic Design tab that displays cross-section distribution and drag at Mach 1 for area ruling purposes
