   Serious thanks:        a.g., for tons of bugfixes and code-refactorings
                stupid_chris, for the RealChuteLite implementation
                        Taverius, for correcting a ton of incorrect values
                Tetryds, for finding lots of bugs and issues and not letting me get away with them, and work on example crafts
                        sarbian, for refactoring code for working with MechJeb, and the Module Manager updates
                        ialdabaoth (who is awesome), who originally created Module Manager
                            Regex, for adding RPM support
                DaMichel, for some ferramGraph updates and some control surface-related features
                        Duxwing, for copy editing the readme
